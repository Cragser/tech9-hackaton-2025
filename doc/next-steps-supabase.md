## 🔧 Required Configuration Steps (To Complete Setup)

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Clerk Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key_here

# Supabase Configuration  
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_public_key_here
```

**To get these values:**

#### Clerk Values:
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Select your application
3. Navigate to **API Keys**
4. Copy the **Publishable key** and **Secret key**

#### Supabase Values:
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Project Settings > Data API**
4. Copy the **Project URL** as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
5. Copy the **anon public** key as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY`

### 2. Clerk Dashboard Configuration

1. **Enable Supabase Integration:**
   - Go to Clerk Dashboard → **Integrations**
   - Find the **Supabase** integration
   - Click **Configure** or **Set up**
   - Select your configuration options
   - Click **Activate Supabase integration**
   - **Save the Clerk domain** that appears

### 3. Supabase Dashboard Configuration

1. **Set up Clerk as Third-party Auth Provider:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Sign In / Up**
   - Click **Add provider**
   - Select **Clerk** from the list
   - Paste the **Clerk domain** you copied from step 2
   - Save the configuration

### 4. Database Setup

Run the SQL commands from `doc/supabase-setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

#### Quick Setup (Copy & Paste):
```sql
-- Create the tasks table with a user_id column that maps to a Clerk user ID
CREATE TABLE tasks(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT auth.jwt()->>'sub',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security on the table
ALTER TABLE "tasks" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for users to view their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "User can view their own tasks"
ON "public"."tasks"
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  ((SELECT auth.jwt()->>'sub') = (user_id)::text)
);

-- Create policy for users to insert their own tasks
CREATE POLICY "Users must insert their own tasks"
ON "public"."tasks"
AS PERMISSIVE
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  ((SELECT auth.jwt()->>'sub') = (user_id)::text)
);
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test the Integration
1. **Sign in** to your application
2. **Create tasks** using the form
3. **Verify tasks appear** in the list
4. **Sign out** and **sign in as a different user**
5. **Verify** that you can't see the previous user's tasks
6. **Create tasks** as the new user
7. **Check the Supabase database** to ensure tasks have different `user_id` values

### 3. Test Both Implementations
- **Client-side**: Visit `/` (main page)
- **Server-side**: Visit `/ssr` (server-side rendered page)

Both should work identically but with different rendering approaches.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Tasks show for all users:**
   - Verify RLS is enabled on the table
   - Check that RLS policies were created correctly
   - Ensure your Clerk domain is properly configured in Supabase

2. **Environment variables not working:**
   - Ensure `.env.local` exists in your project root
   - Restart your development server after adding environment variables
   - Verify variable names have the correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side variables

3. **Authentication errors:**
   - Verify Clerk integration is activated in the Clerk dashboard
   - Check that Clerk is properly configured as a provider in Supabase
   - Ensure your JWT tokens are being passed correctly

4. **Database connection issues:**
   - Verify your Supabase URL and key are correct
   - Check that your Supabase project is active
   - Ensure the `tasks` table exists in your database

## 🚀 Next Features to Implement

After completing the basic integration, consider adding:

- **Update and Delete operations** for tasks
- **Real-time subscriptions** using Supabase's real-time features
- **Enhanced UI/UX** with animations and better feedback
- **Error handling** and user notifications
- **Data validation** on both client and server
- **Task categories or priority levels**
- **User profile synchronization** using Clerk webhooks
- **Search and filtering** functionality
- **Task completion status** and due dates

## 🎯 Summary

Your Clerk-Supabase integration is **fully implemented** and ready to use! You just need to:

1. ✅ Add environment variables (`.env.local`)
2. ✅ Configure Clerk dashboard (enable Supabase integration)
3. ✅ Configure Supabase dashboard (add Clerk as auth provider)
4. ✅ Run the SQL setup commands
5. ✅ Test the application

Once these steps are complete, you'll have a fully functional task management app with:
- 🔐 Secure authentication via Clerk
- 🗄️ Database storage via Supabase
- 🔒 Row-level security ensuring users only see their own data
- 🎨 Modern, responsive UI
- ⚡ Both client-side and server-side rendering options
