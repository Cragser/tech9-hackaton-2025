AI Integration Rules

React Query Integrations
Begin creating all React Query integrations. For now:

All functions must return mock data.

Any "save" actions should pretend success (return a positive response).

Endpoints to Support (Mocked)

Save issue information

Get issues list

Get @app user profile

Loading Behavior

Each API call must simulate a 400ms delay.

Display a skeleton loader that matches the expected UI structure during this delay.

Folder Convention

Any file that performs an API call must be placed inside the @modules folder.

Package Manager

Use pnpm for all dependency management.
